	<p id="theatre_reflection" class="paragraph">
		On September 17th, 2022, I went, with a few friends, to the MHS Theatre production of Puffs. The event lasted roughly two hours in the Magnolia High School Auditorium. I had never attended a theatre production before, and the entire experience was entirely outside of my box and something I hadn’t seen before. Fine arts are extremely creative and unique, and I was happy to have seen another side of that department at MHS. Although attending the production may have appeared to be an individual activity, I went with numerous friends and experienced it as a group. I planned and organized a group of friends to attend the production with me. I learned that plays and productions like these are extremely time intensive. However, they yield incredible results. I really enjoyed Puffs and I would absolutely attend another play after this. Something I learned about myself is that despite how interesting and cool the lay weas to me, I don’t think I could be in one. I had interest in theatre before, but the actual experience of seeing one in person wasn’t entirely up my alley, and not something I could be in. The actual planning process of this experience started from me wanting to attend the show because I had a lot of friends in it. After a had bought my ticket and was set on attending, I had to go to my CAS interview where it was described that I could go an experience as a group and plan it. I started asking a couple friends if they wanted to go to the play and slowly formed a roughly six-person group to go with me to the production.
